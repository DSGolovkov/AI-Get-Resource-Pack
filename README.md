# PS Get Resource Pack

I spent lot of time preparing icons for developers. I've understood, that standart Illustrator functions can't help me. So i decided
to create two scripts, for iOS and for Android, to help me prepare resources more effectively. I'd like to share them with you.

## Installation

- Download .jsx files
- Place them in Presets/Scripts drectory of Adobe Illustrator
- Look this video to assign hotkeys (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5EWASSk9MI&feature=youtu.be)

## How to use them

- Use Selection Tool (V), to select objects you need to prepare
- Use GetSVG (for Android) or GetPDF (for iOS)
- Choose directory for resources
- Rejoice
